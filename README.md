# TIKdevil

Fastest batch TIKs (eShop TIcKets) maker and installer on the planet, right on your 3DS!

# Features
- Doesn't anymore rely on encTitleKeys.bin nor any files, direct table parse from that title key site;
- **Complete revamp, 1 click take-them-all in less than 5 minutes**;
- **Reads already installed tickets and only generates missing ones**;
- **Direct installs generated tickets!**
- Removes temp files, leaving only table for local storage.

**Soon**
- Region filtering; (partially implemented)
- Separate menu items for single things;
- QR to CIA for quick installing and updating TIKdevil;
- **eShop redirection**;
- More speeding and stuff :smile_cat: 

# Building
LibCTRU v.1.1.0 or higher is required, this version is not installed with devkitPro by default. This must be compiled, the lazy can look at my fork.

The bt folder contains buildtools for the 3ds, up to date as of 5/29/2016.

The code in my fork has been modified to compile with a standard devkitPro Windows environment, excepting changes above. Run make and magic happens.
